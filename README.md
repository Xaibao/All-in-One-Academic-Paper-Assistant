# All-in-One-Academic-Paper-Assistant
The primary goal of this system is to leverage natural language processing technology to help researchers and scholars manage, retrieve, and compare academic papers more efficiently. Users can upload research papers, and the system will automatically extract the title and abstract, then generate useful summaries and key points. It can also perform semantic searches based on user queries to identify the most relevant results from the uploaded papers, and even compare the content of different papers.
